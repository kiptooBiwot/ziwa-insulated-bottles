            Hi, we are Ziwa. We believe that every sip should be a delightful
            experience! We&#39;re a Kenyan- based drinkware brand dedicated to
            transforming your everyday hydration into a fun, stylish and
            functional adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is for every Ziwa product to be a valuable addition to the
            rollercoaster that life is. Our MO is functional vessels designed to
            keep your drinks just the way you like them—hot or cold—all day
            long. Whether you're hiking up a mountain, heading to the gym, or
            simply chilling at home, our sleek and sturdy vessels are the
            perfect companions for every occasion.
          </p>

          <p>
            But we don't stop at functionality! We know that your drinkware
            should be as unique as you are. That's why we offer personalized
            options of a variety of colors, with an option to add your name,
            initials or favorite quote. It's not just a bottle; it's your
            bottle.

          <p>
            We understand that great things happen outside, so that is why every
            Ziwa vessel is designed to ensure that wherever life takes you, you

          <!-- <p class="text-xl font-medium">
            Imagine a world where every sip you take is not just for sustainance or for to quench your thirst. Picture a
            Monday morning, you make your tea or coffee in a Ziwa Insulated Mug with your favourite quote engraved. You're
            unable to finish your beverage and you take it with you to work. Hours later you need a pick me up and when
            you open your mug your beverage is still hot. Just the way you like it.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's the world that Ziwa is trying to create. From superior thermal retention capabilities, the leak proof
            design and an aesthetically pleasing vessel that is personalised your own way. We offer superior quality
            products for adults and kids in the sleeves of designs for the African Market.
          </p> -->
