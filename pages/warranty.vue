      <!-- <p>
        We stand behind the quality and craftsmanship of our products. Every Ziwa product is made to the highest quality
        and we take our vessel performance very seriously. Which is why, this warranty covers defects in materials and
        workmanship for a period of [5 years] from the date of purchase.</p>

      <ol class="list-decimal space-y-3">
        <li class="font-bold">Thermal Performance</li>
        <p>
          We stand by the vacuum insulation of all Ziwa products. While it's rare for vacuum insulation of Ziwa products
          to fail, it is a possibility. The only way to rest this is to see if the temperature of what is inside the
          vessel make the outside hot or cold. E.g cold icy water inside makes the vessel cold on the outside as well. If
          this happens, contact us to confirm eligibility for replacement.
